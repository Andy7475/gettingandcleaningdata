For course project in coursera

The run_analysis.R script assumes you have data downloaded and extracted into your working directory from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#.

It will merge a number of datasets from this collection and create a tidy data set (tidy_data.txt) that has the mean value for each variable for every subject and activity combination.

The variables are all means and standard deviations of a number of acceleration and angular velocity measurements collected during specific activities. A full description of the data can be found at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

The code is commented throughout to explain each step.
